# B-AI / Transaction Classifier

Final projet for the Building AI course

## Summary
 
An AI to automatically classify transactions into the right categories to assist budgeting. Should be easy to use.
      
        
## Background

Automatically classifying transactions would help a lot with keeping track of your budget. I wanted to do this because I'm lazy and don't want to do manual labor to classify everything by hand every year.

I also had other interesting ideas, but they would not be implementable within the scope of this course.
        
## How is it used?

    IN: CSV-file on its own.
    OUT: Laballed CSV-file.
    Applicable situation: To save time figuring out your spendings.
    Users: Everyone who needs an overview of their budget and spendings.
    Needs: Should be easy to use, not make things take longer
              
      
        
```
      
def main(in):
   # classify according to recipient and product
   # add to csv file
   

```
      
        
## Data sources and AI methods
      
Data sources would be CSV-files generated by banks, and/or receipts/bills for filling in information gaps<.
These would be collecteed by the user themselves.
      
 
## Challenges
        
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
      
        
## What next?

Add data parsed from pdfs.
